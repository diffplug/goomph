## IDE-as-build-artifact.

It is possible to have many installations of the Eclipse IDE share a common set of installed artifacts, called a "bundlepool".  This means it is fast and efficient to get a purpose-built IDE for every project, preconfigured with all the plugins and settings appropriate for the project at hand.

When you run `gradlew ide`, it builds and downloads an IDE into `build/oomphIde` with just the features you need.  Takes ~15 seconds and 1MB of disk space once all the common artifacts have been cached at `~/.goomph`.

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.diffplug.gradle.oomph.ide'
oomphIde {
	repoEclipseLatest()
	jdt {}
	eclipseIni {
		vmargs('-Xmx2g')    // IDE can have up to 2 gigs of RAM
	}
	style {
		classicTheme()  // oldschool cool
		niceText()      // with nice fonts and visible whitespace
	}
}
```

See the [plugin's javadoc](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/oomph/OomphIdePlugin.html) for a quickstart, and [HOW_TO_AUTOMATE_IDE.md](HOW_TO_AUTOMATE_IDE.md) for examples and more in-depth details.

## Building OSGi bundles, Eclipse plugins, and RCP applications.

It turns out that the tooling required to implement "IDE-as-build-artifact" is the same tooling required to build Eclipse plugins and RCP applications in the first place.  That is Goomph's other side.  For a canonical example which demonstrates Goomph in use on a real project, see the [Gradle and Eclipse RCP talk](https://github.com/diffplug/gradle_and_eclipse_rcp).

Real world Eclipse software built with Goomph:
- [DiffPlug](https://www.diffplug.com/)
- [Veriluma](http://veriluma.com/)
- [GenStar](https://github.com/ANRGenstar/genstar)
- (your project here)

Below is an index of Goomph's capabilities, along with links to the javadoc where you can find usage examples.

**`com.diffplug.gradle.osgi` Plugin for generating OSGi metadata.**

* [`bndmanifest`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/osgi/BndManifestPlugin.html) generates a manifest using purely bnd, and outputs it for IDE consumption.
* [`OsgiExecable`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/osgi/OsgiExecable.html) makes it easy to run a chunk of code within an OSGi container, and get the result from outside the container.

**`com.diffplug.gradle.eclipse` Plugins for creating and manipulating eclipse project files.**

* [`buildproperties`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/eclipse/BuildPropertiesPlugin.html) uses [`build.properties`](http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.pde.doc.user%2Fguide%2Ftools%2Feditors%2Fmanifest_editor%2Fbuild.htm) to control a gradle build, and fixes eclipse project classpath to include binary assets specified in `build.properties`.
* [`excludebuildfolder`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/eclipse/ExcludeBuildFolderPlugin.html) excludes the gradle `build` folder from Eclipse's resource indexing.
* [`projectdeps`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/eclipse/ProjectDepsPlugin.html) fixes an intermittent problem where dependencies on other projects within the workspace aren't always resolved correctly within Eclipse.
* [`resourcefilters`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/eclipse/ResourceFiltersPlugin.html) adds resource filters to the eclipse project.

**`com.diffplug.gradle.p2` Tasks and plugins for manipulating p2 data.**

* [`asmaven`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/p2/AsMavenPlugin.html) downloads dependencies from a p2 repository and makes them available in a local maven repository.
* [`P2Model`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/p2/P2Model.html) models a set of p2 repositories and IUs, and provides convenience methods for running p2-director or the p2.mirror ant task against these.
* [`P2AntRunner`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/p2/P2AntRunner.html) runs eclipse ant tasks.
* [`FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/p2/FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher.html) models the FeaturesAndBundlesPublisher eclipse application.
* [`Repo2Runnable`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/p2/Repo2Runnable.html) models the Repo2Runnable eclipse application.

**`com.diffplug.gradle.pde` Tasks for running Eclipse PDE using a downloaded eclipse instance.**

* [`PdeBuildTask`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/pde/PdeBuildTask.html) runs PDE build to build an RCP product.
* [`PdeAntBuildTask`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/pde/PdeAntBuildTask.html) runs PDE on an ant file.

**`com.diffplug.gradle.swt` Plugins for working with SWT in Gradle.**

* [`nativedeps`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/swt/NativeDepsPlugin.html) adds the platform-specific SWT jars to the runtime classpath so that SWT code can run.

**`com.diffplug.gradle` Miscellaneous infrastructure.**

* [`CmdLineTask`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/CmdLineTask.html) runs a series of shell commands, possibly copying or moving files in the meantime.
* [`JavaExecable`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/JavaExecable.html) makes it easy to run a chunk of code in a separate JVM, and get the result back in this one.
* [`JavaExecWinFriendly`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/JavaExecWinFriendly.html) overcomes limitations in Windows' commandline length and long classpaths.

**`com.diffplug.gradle.eclipserunner` Infrastructure for running headless eclipse applications.**

* Used to power the infrastructure above.
* [`com.diffplug.gradle.equinoxlaunch`](https://diffplug.github.io/goomph/javadoc/3.9.1/com/diffplug/gradle/eclipserunner/EquinoxLaunchPlugin.html) can configure and run equinox applications as part of the build, such as a code generator.
